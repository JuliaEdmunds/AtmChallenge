# ATM Challenge

## Project goal
This project aims at refreshing Python knowledge.   

## Project description
The ATM supports cash withdrawal, adding money to the ATM, and checking the current balance of the ATM. For cash withdrawal, the ATM takes a whole number and considers the current balance (currencies denominations and how many of each are available). The ATM prints out how many of each denomination it should give to make the cash withdrawal possible (like an ATM choosing which banknotes to give out). It uses as few notes as possible and prints ERROR if the withdrawal is not possible with the given denominations. The types of denominations and number of each available are variable.

## Run configurations
Always run the project from main.py
